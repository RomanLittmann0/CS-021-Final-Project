Hello! Welcome to this Untitled Farming Game!

The only controls are left click, so it should be easy to use. You will need PyGame

1. Run the file 'game.py' to start the game. The game will start immediately.
2. Click on a farm plot to plant crops. Crops will grow on pre-determined intervals of 15 and 30 seconds. When a farm has reached step '3' as shown in the upper left corner of the farm, you can click on it to harvest. After harvesting, it will be unusable for a period of time.
3. The number of crops you have is shown in the top right of the screen, as is the amount of money you have.
4. Clicking on the 'Shop' button (top left) brings you to the shop, and the back button returns you to the farm.
5. Sell crops, buy power-ups, and win the game from the shop.
6. 1 crop = 20 currency. For testing reasons, each power-up is only 20 coins, even if labeled otherwise. The only power-up that can be used more than once is the 'Rename Farm' power-up. All others are one-time use. You may sell crops any number of times.
7. Upon buying the 'New Crop' power-up, a new button will appear on the farm screen. This allows you to switch between the two crops you now have, with the current crop's icon being visible.
8. When you want, buy the 'Win!' power-up from the shop. You will be shown a win screen. Please close the game when you are finished looking at the win screen. There is no other action you can take.

<---------- Special Notes ---------->
I. The 'Rename' power-up changes the window's name (top left). It also takes about 2 seconds to work, no need to spam click the power-up.
II. Since crops grow at intervals of 15 and 30 seconds, sometimes, crops will grow almost instantly (ex: the game is at 90 seconds)
III. It's not Bitcoin, it's "Big Bucks". The coin has a 'B' on it because I drew a really cool 'B' when making the coin.
IV. All artwork is mine besides the backgrounds, 'Store' button, and 'Back' button
V. Maybe there's an easter egg.
